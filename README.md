# **CS 272 - Introduction to Data Structures**

## **Course description:** 
Design, implementation, use of fundamental abstract data types and their algorithms: lists, stacks, queues, deques, trees; imperative and declarative programming. Internal sorting; time and space efficiency of algorithms.

## Lab description:
# Lab 1: Eclipse tutorial & file operations
- Get familiar with Eclipse IDE.
- File operations.

# Lab 2: Class definition and usage (OOP)
- Use the data read in Lab 1.
- Specify and design a class from the data.
- Create setters & getters.

# Lab 3: Collection class
- Design a data structure to store the data and support basic operations.
- The data structure should implement the functionality of a collection whose space can grow automatically.

# Lab 4: Singly Linked List - basic operations
- Design a linked list with the requirements.
- Implement the methods required.
- Design the test to throughly test all cases.

# Lab 5: Singly Linked List - advanced
- Implement more advanced methods to the previous lab.
- Design the test to throughly test all cases.

# Lab 6: Analyzing the running time of program
- Analyze the worst-case run time of the programs.

# Lab 7: Doubly Linked List with Dummy Head and Tail
- Implement a double linked list with dummy head and tail.
- Design the functions assigned.

# Lab 8: Generic Programming, Implement and Use Stacks
- Write a generic interface for stack.
- Write a generic class for singly linked list.
- Implement stack using singly linked list.
- Implement stack using array list.
- Solve the N-Queen problem using the stack implemented.

# Lab 9: Generic Programming, Implement and Use Queue
- Write a generic interface for queue.
- Implement queue using singly linked list.
- Implement queue using array list.
- Use linkedqueue implemented to test if a string is a palindrome.

# Lab 10: Recursive Thinking
Design and implement the following programs using recursion:
- Calculate the kth Fibonacci.
- Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.
- Show the call level.
- Print the value of the imput as binary number.
- Print out the patterns requested.
- Print the permutations of a requested array of distinct integers.

# Lab 11: Recursive trace, recursive reasoning, and recursive function analysis
- Draw revursive trace of the given function.
- Prove the correctness of a fuction by induction.
- Analyze the time complexity of the given function.

# Lab 12: Binary Search Tree
- Design and implement methods to manipulate data in a BST.
- Analyze the time complexity of the written methods.
- Design the test to throughly test all cases.

# Lab 13: Heap and Search
- Implement the requested methods for a min heap.
- Design the binary search function for an element in an array.

# Lab 14: Hash
- Design a hash table to implement the open-address hashing data structure.
- Design a main function to make use of the implemented hash table.
